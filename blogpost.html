            <p class="font1">Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it’s worth noting
                the nuances between the two. Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all sub-fields of
                artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually a sub-field of machine learning, and deep
                learning is a sub-field of neural networks.

                The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm learns. "Deep"
                machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised learning, to inform its algorithm,
                but it doesn’t necessarily require a labeled dataset. Deep learning can ingest unstructured data in its
                raw form (e.g., text or images), and it can automatically determine the set of features which
                distinguish different categories of data from one another. This eliminates some of the human
                intervention required and enables the use of larger data sets. You can think of deep learning as
                "scalable machine learning" as Lex Fridman notes in this MIT lecture (01:08:05) (link resides outside
                IBM).

                Classical, or "non-deep", machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn. Human
                experts determine the set of features to understand the differences between data inputs, usually
                requiring more structured data to learn.

                Neural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of node layers, containing an input
                layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to
                another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the
                specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network.
                Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network by that node. The “deep” in deep
                learning is just referring to the number of layers in a neural network. A neural network that consists
                of more than three layers—which would be inclusive of the input and the output—can be considered a deep
                learning algorithm or a deep neural network. A neural network that only has three layers is just a basic
                neural network.

                Deep learning and neural networks are credited with accelerating progress in areas such as computer
                vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.</p>
            <p class="font1"><b>How machine learning works?</b><br>
                1. A Decision Process: In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or
                classification. Based on some input data, which can be labeled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce
                an estimate about a pattern in the data. <br>
                2. An Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If there are known
                examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model. <br>
                3. A Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the training set,
                then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate.
                The algorithm will repeat this “evaluate and optimize” process, updating weights autonomously until a
                threshold of accuracy has been met.
            </p>
            <p class="font1"><b>Supervised machine learning.</b><br>
                Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use of labeled
                datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into
                the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of
                the cross validation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting. Supervised
                learning helps organizations solve a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam
                in a separate folder from your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks,
                naïve bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM).
            </p>
            <p class="font1"><b>Unsupervised machine learning.</b><br>
                Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to
                analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings
                without the need for human intervention. This method’s ability to discover similarities and differences
                in information make it ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer
                segmentation, and image and pattern recognition. It’s also used to reduce the number of features in a
                model through the process of dimensionality reduction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular
                value decomposition (SVD) are two common approaches for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised
                learning include neural networks, k-means clustering, and probabilistic clustering methods.
                <br>
                <b>Semi-supervised learning.</b><br>
                Semi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning. During
                training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a
                larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of not having enough labeled
                data for a supervised learning algorithm. It also helps if it’s too costly to label enough data.
